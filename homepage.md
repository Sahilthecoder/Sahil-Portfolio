Areas for Improvement:
Hero Section
Consider adding a brief professional tagline under your name
The "Contact Me" button could be more prominent
About Section
The section is well-written but could include 1-2 more key achievements
Consider adding a professional headshot (you mentioned keeping only the hero image, which is fine)
Experience Highlights
The three key areas (Inventory, Process, Leadership) are well-chosen
Consider adding one more metric to each card (e.g., "37% reduction in discrepancies" is great, but could add "saving $X annually")
Contact Information
Make sure your contact information is easily accessible
Consider adding a professional email address if not already present
Suggestions for Enhancement:
Testimonials Section
Consider adding 1-2 brief testimonials from colleagues or managers
This adds social proof to your claims
Skills Visualization
The skills are well-listed, but a simple visualization (like progress bars) could make them more scannable
Call-to-Action
Add a clear CTA in the hero section (e.g., "View My Work" or "Download CV")
Make sure the "Contact Me" button is highly visible
